GNU Readline bindings for Standard ML
Gian Perrone, October 2011

This is possibly the crudest FFI binding ever created. It should not be held up
as an example of a style to emulate.

Running 'make' will build a binary readline-test, which uses the readline and
history libraries to provide nice interactive text input.

Compiling this will require that you have GNU Readline installed somewhere that
is in your path.
